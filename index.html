  <div class="col-md-6"><p style="font-size: 165%"> Italian presence in Australia, dates all the way back to before the First Fleet.
    Ever since the ship ‘Endeavour’, with captain James Cook in 1770, Italians have been flocking to our country for
    reasons including: obtaining a better life, finding work and building themselves a safer future.
The first rush was in the 1850’s with Victoria’s gold rush period, the second big influx not occurring until
after World War II, with the number of Italians in Victoria peaking at 121,000 in 1971.
Although many years have passed since, every year italian immigration continues. Our Italian-born Australian population grows larger and hence enhances the strength of italian culture in our country.
<br>
The only reason I am here today is because of my Nonna(grandmother) and Nonno’s(grandfather) desire to migrate to Australia for
 a better life for the both of them and to create the very family that i am apart of now.
In Italy now, life is very different to Australia. Children still leave their homes and their families early on in life, in order to make a living,
to get a good job or to study. Their study focus lies mainly in the fields of hospitality and tourism.
School is only compulsory until 16 years of age, so many move to Australia to further their studies. Although the rates of immigration from Italy to Australia have lessened,
 the reasons for Italians leaving Italy to come to Australia have stayed the same.</p>

  <div class="col-md-12"><h1>Life before Migration</h1><p style="font-size: 125%">Maria-Josephine Rosato was born October 12, 1943 in Crespano Del Grappa, Veneto Region, Italy.
    One of 4 children she spent her time going to school, before at 11 years of age, moving to a big city called Busto Arsizio,
    Lombardia to became a nanny. She did not always know my Nonno, (Fiorenzo)Domenic Pegoraro. He was born on May 3, 1938. One of six
    children, he grew up in Bassano Del Grappa, Veneto Region, Italy. <br> He went to school for five years before leaving to work
    in a factory for a while. At the age of only 22 in 1960, struggling to find work, he joined the army for a year. Their paths
    crossed 60 years ago in 1957, at a party in the mountains in Covolo. My Nonna was 13 and my Nonno was 18. My Grandmother had said that, "in that time,
     when you met someone you knew you liked you had to hold onto them." They were both so young and so unaware of how their
     lives would change in the next 3 years.</p>

<section><a name="Leaving Italy"></a>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6"><h1>Leaving Italy</h1><p style="font-size: 120%">Maria Rosato was 18 when she came to Australia in 1962, in search of a better life, a better career and to start a family.
  She came on a 28 day trip on a boat called Neptunia (Nave Neptunia). Her soon to be husband, Domenic, had been in Australia for a year previous to that, trying to work to prepare for her arrival.
   After they were married in Australia, they lived with Domenic’s aunty for a while, before moving to Tottenham to live in a bungalow for a year. They
   then lived with Domenic’s uncle for a year, before building their own house in St Albans. Maria said that in their street in that time,
   "there were people from all over the world" living next to them, who had come to Australia for the same reasons as her.
   They lived in that house in St Albans for 33 years before moving. Maria believes that she has had many homes while she has been here but, Australia as a whole is now where she belongs</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6"><h1>Early Australia Days</h1><p style="font-size: 150%">In early days, Maria said the Australian people were very nasty to her because she could not speak English.
   She believed that this prejudice was due to the fact that Australians did not understand what the Europeans went through
   to get to Australia, they didn’t know their story. Her first job was working for Pelaco in Richmond making men’s shirts.
   She then went on to take on a very serious role at Schweppes for many years. She told the story of how the opportunity to
   work, created problems for her personal life. Her lifestyle was very different to that of what it would have been if she were to stay in Italy. She spoke of her memories working "so much that your grandfather threatened to leave if i didnt spend more time with them."
<br>
   She was, for a time, devoted to her work. She enjoyed having something that she knew she was good at. Of course at first,
    Maria felt uncomfortable living in a country that she didn’t know. She stayed inside, maintaining only a diet of bread and
     milk. She said she would "cry for days, wishing to be back in Italy." In that time, there was only one place where she felt she could get Italian food
    from and that was a Deli and butcher in Buckley Street. Being able to go there made her feel like she was back in Italy for a second,
    because she could use those ingredients to cook Italian meals at home. </p>

<section><a name="Still Call Australia Home"></a>
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6"><h1>Still call Australia Home</h1><p style="font-size: 120%">After quite some time, going out became a way for Maria and Domenic to include themselves into the Australian community.
  They would go to the movies in Footscray, they would go camping to Yarrawonga and Mildura in their caravan and would also go for picnics somewhere local.
<br>
After teaching herself to speak English by listening to the radio and watching television, going out and socializing with other recent migrants
and stepping into the workforce, she realized what opportunities our country could bring her. Now she strongly suggests that she would never go back
to Italy and Australia is her home. </p>
